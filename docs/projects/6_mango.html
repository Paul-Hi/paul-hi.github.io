<p>Mango is an Open Source Framework. Or at least it should be in the future. A playground for people like me.</p>

<p>Just to be clear: This is not the first attempt! I plan to implement various features, with main focus on computer graphics. A few of them are described below, but there will be added a lot more in the future. There should also always be a documentation and tests to ensure cleaner and more functional code.</p>
